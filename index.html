        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I’m a current college student attending the University of California, Riverside for Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. Throughout this page you will be able to identify personal skills and experience that hone towards the represented major. As with everyone, I’m continuously learning and adding on into these subjects to be able to expand my knowledge about the Marketing world. I aspire to open up my own florist business as well as participate in Real Estate in the near future. <br><br>

        My personal experience resonates with community service opportunities such as the Rose Parade Student Ambassador program which created a local community effort to partake in the process of the Rose Parade events and behind-the-scenes situations that allow the day to flow effortlessly for visitors all over the country. It became a networking experience as we were all students around the Pasadena area who attended different high schools. Communicating effectively to be able to work together as a team was a significant skill. Babysitting has also been a part of my job experience as I created enrichment activities for younger children who are constantly moving around. It required of being able to quickly resolve a problematic situation while keeping a positive attitude at all times. It has allowed me to create empathy towards the people that surround my circle and being able to see situations from a different perspective. This allows for an open-mind when it comes to coming up with solutions and new ideas that may persists in many important projects.<br>

        Skills that represent my work ethic would include organizational, detail-oriented, time-management, communication, and problem-solving. The following are examples of how they represent me, organizational skills by keeping a Google Calendar and Notes with a list of my class schedule and things I need to get done promptly throughout the week, creative thinking skills whenever it comes to slides presentations of using Canva to represent my ideas/theme that I want to create and a huge motivational drive as a first-gen student who is attending college to be able to provide the best for my parents who have set their life aside to create better opportunities for us. As a first generation daughter who’s the oldest, I have always taken action within a problem to come to a resolution with no one to ask for help when it comes to personal issues.One thing about me is that I pay close attention to detail whenever I’m getting a task done whether it be a homework assignment, presentation, personal situation as well as attentive of what’s going on around me without having to ask around about what might be the problem. I value communication being able to create a open environment that allows problems to be resolved in an efficient and timely manner without unnecessary miscommunication, friendship as being close to one another allows things to be less tense and open-minded, trustworthiness to be able to speak to anyone without resilience being given a task that requires a large responsibility.<br>
